# Introduction:
MUedit is a Matlab app that decomposes electromyographic (EMG) signals recorded from multiple electrodes into individual motor unit pulse trains using fast independent component analysis (fastICA). You can easily adjust the parameters of the algorithm to the specificity of your experimental settings. After the decomposition, you can display and edit the output of the fastICA, i.e., the motor unit pulse trains.

We provide a step-by-step protocol (User_manual.pdf) to facilitate the implementation of MUedit in any experimental settings. You can also read our paper that describes the method, the main steps of the experiments, and the capabilities of the app (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38761514/). 

You can download the data presented in the paper at https://figshare.com/projects/Data_for_MUedit/172314

A version of the decomposition algorithm coded with Python (Python 3.9.15) by Ciara Gibbs (ciara.gibbs18@imperial.ac.uk) will be available soon at https://github.com/ciaragibbs/MUEdit_Python
